## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. What is a ‘call’?  
   - Single function(s) execution from top to bottom.
2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
3. What does LIFO mean?
   - Last In Fist Out - Stores and manages function invocation(call)  


4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.  

```
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}
function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}  
function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}  
thirdFunction();
```

5. What causes a Stack Overflow?  
   - A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. 
   ```
   function callMyself(){
  callMyself();
}

callMyself();
   ```

## JavaScript error messages

1. What is a ‘refrence error’?  
   - This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors. 
   ```
    console.log(foo) // Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined
    ````
2. What is a ‘syntax error’?  
   - cannot be parsed in terms of syntax  and fixed by correcting the syntax
   ```
   JSON.parse( {'foo': 'bar'} ) // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1
   ```  
3. What is a ‘range error’?  
   - Giving an invalid length. 
 ```
   var foo= []
foo.length = foo.length -1 // Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length
```  
4. What is a ‘type error’?  
   - types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible  
```
var foo = {}
foo.bar // undefined
foo.bar.baz // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'baz' of undefined
```  
5. What is a breakpoint?  

6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?  
   - creates a breakpoint to handle errors
   - debugging is one of your biggest weapons has a developer, do it frequently and with enough time you will notice a great decrease in the time you spend on each error
