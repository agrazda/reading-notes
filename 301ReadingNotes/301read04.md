# React and Forms  
## Forms
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?  
   - An input form element whose value is controlled by React  
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.  
   - I dont know Yet
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?  
   - runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types

## Conditional (Ternar) Operator
1. Why would we use a ternary operator? 
   - shorter code and yeilds the same results
   - The condition is what you’re actually testing 

## The Need to Know 

   - The condition is what you’re actually testing. The result of your condition should be true or false or at least coerce to either boolean value.
   - A ? separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.
   - Finally a : colon. If your condition evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed.

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:  

```
if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
```  

```  
x===y ? value if true : value if false
```
