# Putting it all together

## Thinking in React  

1. How would you break a mock into a component heirarchy?
   - Draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names  
2. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
   - A component should ideally only do one thing   
3. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application? 
   -  Building components that reuse other components and pass data using props 
   - DO NOT USE STATE AT ALL to build this static version
4. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?  
5. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
   -  Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
   - Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
   - Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
6. How can you identify where state needs to live?  
   - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
