### **HTML Chapter 10 Intro to CSS**

What does CSS do?  
>It Allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.

>CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look. 

External CSS
- Utilizes a *< link href="" type="" rel="">* to refernce a css file  
  - All of you web pages can share the same style sheet; The same code does not need to be repeated.
  - Once the user has downloaded the css stylesheet the rest of the site will load faster

Internal CSS
- Utilizes a *< style type="text/css">* tag to insert CSS directly into HTML
  - Works well if you are only creating one page.
  - Saves you from having to create multiple files

CSS Selectors
- Allow you to target css rules to specific elements in an HTML document
