# Implementation: Hash Tables  

## What is a Hash Table?  
- Data structure that utilize key value pairs. 
- all ```Node``` and ```bucket``` have ```key: Value``` pairs 



## Creating a Hash  
1. Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
2. Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
3. Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
4. Insert into the array at that index.  

## The Big O  
Calculating the hash code and reading an array at that index is all constant time to the hash map has O(1) read access
