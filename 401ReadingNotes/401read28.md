# Component Lifecycle / ```useEffect()```  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
Outside the ```<BrowserRouter/>```
Inside the ```<BrowserRouter />```, outside a ```<Route />```
Inside a ```<Route />```
3. What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
4. What does props.children contain?
5. How do ```useState()``` and ```this.setState()``` differ?
