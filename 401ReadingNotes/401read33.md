# ```<Login />``` and ```<Auth />```  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. Why is the Context API useful?
   - The ability to set the theme
   - To implement multiple languages in app  
   - Authorization: setting the user role and info
2. Can a component outside of a provider get its context?  
   - Yes. This is the function of the useContext() hook.
3. What are some common use cases for using the Context API?
   - is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API
```
const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
     <ReduxProvider value={store}>
      <ThemeProvider value={theme}>
       <OtherProvider value={otherValue}>
        <OtherOtherProvider value={otherOtherValue}>
         {/** ... other providers*/}
                                <HellProvider value={hell}>
                                  <HelloWorld />
                                </HellProvider>
         {/** ... other providers*/}
        </OtherOtherProvider>
       </OtherProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
     </ReduxProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```
