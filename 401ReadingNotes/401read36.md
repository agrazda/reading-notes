# Application State with Redux  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
   - Cookies are mainly for reading server-side, whereas local storage can only be read by the client-side
2. Explain 3rd party cookies.
   - A third-party cookie is placed on a website by someone other than the owner (a third party) and collects user data for the third party
3. How do pixel tags work? 
   - attach to a browser and collect information about an anonymous user's movements on the Internet
