# Stacks and Queues  

Define Stack:
- Like a linked list, a stack isa data structure that consists of Notes and each Node references the next node but not the previous.

### Stack Terminology:
 Term             | Definition   | 
| :-------------: | :----------: | 
| Push      | Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed   | 
| Pop       | Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped  | 
| top       | top of the stack.   |
| Peek      | view the value of the top Node in the stack  | 
| isEmpty   | returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.  |  

### Stack Concepts  
```F```irst ```I```n ```L```ast ```O```ut  
The fist item added will be last to pop

```L```ast ```I```n ```F```irst ```O```ut 
The last item added will be first to pop

Push O(1)  
- adding a node to the stak will always be a O(1) operation  

Pop O(1)  
- When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below  

Peek O(1)  
- you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack  

isEmpty O(1)  
- returns a boolean if the stack is empty or not  

## What is a Queue?  

### Queue Terminology  

Term             | Definition   | 
| :-------------: | :----------: | 
| Enqueue  | Nodes or items that are added to the queue   | 
| Dequeue  | Nodes or items that are removed from the queue  | 
| Front    | First Node in the queue   |
| Rear     | Last Node in the queue  | 
| Peak     | view the value of the front Node   | 
| isEmpty  | returns when the queue is empty otherwise returns false |  

```F```irst ```I```n ```F```irst```L```ast ```O```ut  
The fist item added will be first out of the queue  

```L```ast ```I```n ```L```ast ```O```ut   
The last item added will be last out of the queue

Enqueue O(1)
- add an item to a queue  

DequeueO(1)  
- remove an item from a queue. doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.  

Peek O(1)  
- you will only be inspecting the front Node  

IsEmpty O(1)  
- returns when the queue is empty otherwise returns false
