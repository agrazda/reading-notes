# Redux - Combined Reducers  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
   - context is not a state management tool
   - Redux is used best used for larger apps
2. What is the purpose of a reducer?
What does an action contain?
   - reducers are there to manage state in an application
   - thy cotain a payload
3. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?  
   - You need to copy state because you cannot it cannot change an existing state. the reducer has to make a new object.
