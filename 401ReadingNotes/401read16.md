1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle  
   - The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app  
2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC  
   - The server takes in a request frome and gives a response to the client
3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application? 
   - Rolling out an application to the end user.
