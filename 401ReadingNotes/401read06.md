## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)  
  - design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object
2. Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes  
3. If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
