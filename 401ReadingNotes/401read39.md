# Redux - Additional Topics  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?  
   - using an async action to retreive from database and  useEffect when the component mounts.
2. When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?  
   - export the function
