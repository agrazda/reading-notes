# Access Control (ACL)  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?  
- The Basic authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret   
- The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token 
2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?  
- is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties
3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?  
-  can only contain alphanumeric characters ([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9]) or underscores (_). Spaces are not allowed.    
-  must not start with a number.  
-  are not case-sensitive.
-  must be unique at the level they are created at.
