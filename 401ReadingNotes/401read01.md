### Describe ```array.map()```  
- ```array.map()``` is a built in method that allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function. It returns a new array without modifying the original array.  

### Describe ```array.reduce()```  
- ```array.reduce()``` is a built in method that allows you to reduce an array to a single value.  

### Provide code snippets showing how to use ```superagent()``` : 
- With normal Promise .then() syntax 
- ```const getCharacters =() =>{
  superagent.get('https://swapi.dev/api/people/1')
      .then(data => {
      let obj = {};
      obj[data.body.name] = data.body.url;
      console.log(obj);
      return obj;
    })
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
    }
    getCharacters(); ```  

- Again with ```async/await``` syntax
- ```async function cityData(city){
  let data = await superagent.get(`https://geocode.xyz/${city}?json=1`);
   console.log(data.body.longt, data.body.latt)
    }
    cityData('seattle')
    cityData('dallas')
    cityData('portland')```  

### Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student  
- "A promise in JavaScript is similar to a promise in real life. When we make a promise in real life, it is a guarantee that we are going to do something in the future. Because promises can only be made for the future." - Cem Eygi (Freecodecamp.org)  
- It takes two parameters, one for success (resolve) and one for fail (reject)  
- Finally, there will be a condition. If the condition is met, the Promise will be resolved, otherwise it will be rejected  

### Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?  
- No, Simply taking a callback doesn't make a function asynchronous. There's a difference in the order in which things happen in the timeline, depending on whether the callback is used synchronously or asynchronously.
