# Express REST API  

### 1. Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware  
- Logging  
- Validating
- Authenticating

### 2. True or false: The route handler is middleware?  
-  False

### 3. In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?  
-  

### 4. At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms 

- Middleware
  - functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res)   
- Request Object  
  - object represents the HTTP request  
- Response Object
  - object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request  
- Application Middleware  
  - Bind app-level middleware to an instance of the app object   
- Routing Middleware  
  - bound to an instance of ```express.Router() ```  
- Test Driven Development  
  - software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed  
- Behavioral Testing  
  - behaviour of users
