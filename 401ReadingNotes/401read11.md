# Event Driven Applications  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. Why is access control important?  
    So that not every roll may have access to all information or control

2. Describe an application that would need access control.  
    any app with the ability to add, delete, and create, and does not want its users to have access to some or all of these actions.

3. What is a role used for?
    To have specific athority within an app.
 
4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
    because you can create new roles that have different access to capabilities then other roles.
