# Bearer Authorization  

## Review, Research, and Discussion  

1. Write the following steps in the correct order:
   - Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret  
   - Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party  
   - Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint  
   - Receive authorization code  
   - Make a request to the access token endpoint  
   - Receive access token  
   - Make a request to a third-party API endpoint  

2. What can you do with an authorization code?  
3. What can you do with an access token?  
4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
