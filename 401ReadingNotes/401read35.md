# Graphs  

## Common Terminology  

1. Vertex - aka Node with zero or more adjacent verticies  
2. Edge- connection between 2 nodes    
3. Neighbor- connected via edges  
4. Degree - number of edges a vertex has.  

## Undirected Graphs  
- A Graph where each edge is bi-directional 

## Directed Graphs (Digraph)  
- every edge is directed to a specific vertex  

## Complete Graphs  
- when all vertex are contected to all other vertex  

## Connected Graphs  
- All verticies have at least one edge  

## Disconnected Graphs  
- some vertices may not have edges  

## Acyclic Graph  
- Directed graph without cycles. 
- Cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.  

## Cyclic Graphs  
- graph with cycles  

# Graph Representation  

## Adjacency Matrix
- Represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix. 

## Adjacentcy  
- a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected  

## Weighted Graph  
- numbers assigned to its edges. the numbers are called wieghts
