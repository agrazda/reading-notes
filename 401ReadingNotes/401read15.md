# Trees  

## Reading Notes  

## Vocabulary Terms  

Term             | Definition   | 
| :-------------: | :----------: | 
| Node   | Contains its own value and references to other nodes | 
| Root   | Beggining of the tree | 
| K      | Defines the maximum number of children any node may have in a K tree |
| Left   | Reference to one child node in a binary tree | 
| Right  | Reference to the other child in a binary tree | 
| Edge   | Link between the parent and child node |  
| Leaf   | Node that does not have children |
| Height | Number of edges from root to furthest leaf |

### Traversals  
- Depth First - Going throught the height first  
  - Pre-Order: ```root>>left>>right```  
  - In-order: ```left >> root >> right```  
  - Post-order: ```left >> right >> root```  

  ![tree example](./tree-example.png)

  - Pre-order: ```A, B, D, E, C, F```
  - In-order: ```D, B, E, A, F, C```
  - Post-order: ```D, E, B, F, C, A```

## Pseudocode  
  ```ALGORITHM preOrder(root)```
  ```OUTPUT <-- root.value```
  ```if root.left is not NULL```
      ```preOrder(root.left)```  

  ```if root.right is not NULL```
      ```preOrder(root.right)```  


- Breadth First   

  -Output: ```A, B, C, D, E, F```  

    ```ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)```
// INPUT  <-- root node
// OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

  ````Queue breadth <-- new Queue()```
 ```breadth.enqueue(root)```

  ```while breadth.peek()```
    ```node front = breadth.dequeue()```
    ```OUTPUT <-- front.value```
    ```if front.left is not NULL```
      ```breadth.enqueue(front.left)```  
    ```if front.right is not NULL``` 
      ```breadth.enqueue(front.right)```
