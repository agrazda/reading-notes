## Readings : Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

### **Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming**
#### What Can you do about making a problem domain easier?
    1. Make the problem domain easier
    2. Get better at understanding the problem Domain.
  
### **JS Chapter 3: “Object Literals”**
  - What is an Oject:
    - Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model.
  - In an object:
    - object = {} And what is inside of them.
      - Object is store within a variable.
    - Variables become known as PORPERTIES
    - Functions become known as Methods
    - cannot have two keys the same name

  - Literal Notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects

### **JS Chapter 5: “Document Object Model”**
![DOM Tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/DOM-model.svg)
  - Document Object Model (DOM)
    - Specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the content of a webpage while it is in the browser window.
  - Specifies the way the browser should structure this modle useing **DOM tree**
  - **DOM** is called an object model because it is made of objects. Each object reps a diff part of the page loaded in the browser.
  - **DOM** also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, which turns updates to what the user sees in the browser.

Caching DOM Queries
> Methods that find elements in the DOM tree are Called DOM Queries

Methods that return single element node:
  1. getElement by id('id")
    - selects an indvidual element given the value of its id attribute.
