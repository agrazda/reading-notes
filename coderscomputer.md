# The Coders Computer  
As I read the the artical [Choosing a Text Editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) by The Old Coder, he states:
>I donâ€™t think that it truly matters as to which text editor you use. But for the most part, theyâ€™re all pretty similar. I think it all comes down to the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
  
**I believe that like in life you have to find what works best for you.**  
### What to look for in a Text Editor 
1. *Code Completion*
2. *Syntax Highlighting*
3. *Variety of Themes*
4. *Healthy Selection of Extention*
5. ~~*Something Boring with Bad Quality*~~

When comparing different text editors, you have your "Basic" text editor which comes with your computer that has very few features. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the titleâ€”it edits text.
