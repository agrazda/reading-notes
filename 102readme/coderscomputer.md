# The Coders Computer  
As I read the the artical [Choosing a Text Editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) by The Old Coder, he states:
>I donâ€™t think that it truly matters as to which text editor you use. But for the most part, theyâ€™re all pretty similar. I think it all comes down to the proof of the pudding is in the eating.
  
**I believe that like in life you have to find what works best for you.**  
### What to look for in a Text Editor 
1. *Code Completion*
2. *Syntax Highlighting*
3. *Variety of Themes*
4. *Healthy Selection of Extention*
5. ~~*Something Boring with Bad Quality*~~  

Here are some options to Check out:  
1. **Nopepade++**
   - Free for Windows
   - Syntax Highlighting
   - Code Completion
   - Zoom in and out Features
2. **TextWrangler / BB Edit**
   - Mac users Only
     - Not much info on this one ðŸ˜• 
   - Paid Subscription
3. **Visual Studio Code**
   - Windows, Mac, and Linox
   - Emmet Shorthand for HTML CCS
   - syntax highlighting
   - themes
   - extensions
   - code Completion

When comparing different text editors, you have your "Basic" text editor which comes with your computer that has very few features. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the titleâ€”it edits text.

# Files 
### Everything is a file!
- Linux is an extensionless System
- Linuz is **cAsE** Sensitive (Beware of silly Typos)

# TERMINAL CODE  
- pwd
Where am I in the system.
- ls [path]
> Perform a listing of the given path or your current directory.
> Common options: -l, -h, -a
- cd [path]
> Change into the given path or into your home directory.
- Path
> A description of where a file or directory is on the filesystem.
- Absolute Path
> One beginning from the root of the file system (eg. /etc/sysconfig ).
- Relative Path
> One relative to where you currently are in the system (eg. Documents/music ).
- ~ (tilde)
> Used in paths as a reference to your home directory (eg. ~/Documents ).
- . (dot)
> Used in paths as a reference to your current directory (eg. ./bin ).
- .. (dot dot)
> Used in paths as a reference to your current directories parent directory (eg. ../bin ).
- TAB completion
> Start typing and press TAB. The system will auto complete the path. Press TAB twice and it will show you your alternatives.

# Paths  
Absolute | Relative  
A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system. | A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.  


# Pro Tips
- Up and Down arrows will allow ou to search terminal history so you dont have to retype commands
