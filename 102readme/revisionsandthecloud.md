# What the GIT

## What is GIT?
A Distributed Version Control systems (**DVCS**) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. It is a system that stores snapshots of data. When saving changes (otherwise known as **COMMIT**) GIT takes a snapshot of your progress and changes you have made and stores them for you to reference back to. It tracks all changes and minimize loss.

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.  
> Committed
  -Data is securely stored in a local database

> Modified
  -File has been changed but not committed to the database
  
> Staged
  -Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

The Best part of GIT is that it allows coders to collaborate on ideas, projects, presentation, and store these ideas to make the best version of your vision!
